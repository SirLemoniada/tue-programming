Thus, HIV makes infected people more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. The virus is spread by contact with certain body fluids of an HIV-infected person with a high viral load,<sup>1</sup> especially during unprotected sexual intercourse, blood transfusion, or breastfeeding. Without proper treatment, the virus can lead to the development of the Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). So far, there is no cure for HIV, but people with HIV can have a long and healthy life by following the so-called AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART).\n",

    "The virus was first identified in 1981 after doctors started reporting in the United States of America an unusually high rate of rare forms of pneumonia (i.e. pneumocystis pneumonia) and cancer (i.e. Kaposi's sarcoma) among young gay men in Los Angeles and New York. Global media started referring to the disease as gay cancer, gay disease, or gay plague. Researchers and care providers also started calling it the Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID). The uncertainty around the disease and the terminology that surrounded it supported the stigmatization of the gay community and endured the prejudices against homosexuality. Even in the United States, president Ronald Reagan recognized the existence of the disease in 1985, only after more than 12,000 North Americans had silently died from AIDS. No public health response was given in most countries affected by the virus. This systematic discrimination led to infected gay people hiding their sexual orientation and their illness. Nowadays, we know that HIV can infect any person regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, skin color, or age. Nevertheless, vulnerable populations—such as people living in poverty, black communities, and gay communities—are the most affected by the virus due to harmful societal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Freddie Mercury—an outstanding artist and the lead vocalist of the band Queen—faced the main AIDS symptoms both at physical and social levels. He never defined his sexuality in public nor he gave details about his health condition. The only exception happened on the 22nd of November, 1991: Freddie Mercury announced that he had been tested HIV positive and had AIDS. He died on the 24th of November, aged 45. He had been privately diagnosed HIV positive four years earlier in 1987. The idol didn't live long enough to leverage the ART treatment. Many anti-AIDS organizations have used these stories to bring awareness to the importance of fighting HIV and AIDS worldwide.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although HIV-positive cases—such as Freddie Mercury's case—have become well-known stories representing the impact and severity of HIV and AIDS, western countries are far from being the epicenter of the epidemic. There is scientific evidence that suggests that HIV originated in the 1920s in the now Democratic Republic of Congo. This happened as a result of HIV crossing from chimps to humans; these mammals were hunted and eaten by local communities inhabiting the area. Infected chimps carried the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a virus that is closely related to HIV. However, the outbreak of the virus did not start in Africa but Western countries. It was nearly a decade after that the epidemic took off in the continent, becoming the first cause of death in African countries by 1999.\n",

    "By 2003, around 6,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa died of AIDS-related diseases. As reported in [this article](https://niemanreports.org/articles/aids-in-africa-a-story-that-must-be-told/), that is twice as many deaths as the ones reported in the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center. Research carried in Africa to understand the spread of the virus has been negatively impacted by Western preconceptions. Underdevelopment and inequality—linked to some of the consequences of Western colonialism and slavery—as well as unstable governments are pointing to be some of the most important causes of public health and social issues. Additionally, to understand and address the problem, researchers and politicians should consider the diversity and complexity of the continent: as emphasized by a group of African citizens involved in the fight against HIV and AIDS, Africa is a continent with 53 countries, with a plethora of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups. Even though there is still a long road to go, in 2017 the World Health Organization announced that AIDS was no longer the leading cause of death in Africa.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lack of public measures and attention from the government to the HIV epidemic originated a communal feeling of disregard and abandonment among infected people. This gave rise to a set of movements that protested against the indifference of society. One of the most well-known movements is the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). ACT UP was founded in 1987 in New York. They organized protests and scientific programs to fight HIV and AIDS. Many controversies surrounded the actions of the movement, but their effort led to the development of the first ART treatments. In fact, in 1991 the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 076 study was launched. The study aimed at understanding if the antiretroviral AZT (azidothymidine) could have any effect on avoiding HIV transmission from mother to child during pregnancy. This was the first ART treatment authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency to treat HIV. The treatment would drop the viral load from the mother for a while, reducing the rate of transmission before and during delivery by around 70%. However, the treatment had many collateral effects that raised ethical inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the FDA approved the Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) in 1995. HAART is a regime composed of several drugs, maintaining the correct function of the immune system. Once it was incorporated into practice, the rate of AIDS-related deaths and hospitalizations dropped by 60-80%. However, accessing the treatment is possible only for nations and patients that can afford the related costs. Democratizing medicine so it can be affordable for all people has also been part of the agenda of anti-AIDS movements and organizations during the last years.\n",

    "We would like to investigate how the HAART treatment impacted the number of people living with HIV. \n",
    "To do so, we want to see how the rate of change between 1990-1995 and 1995-2000 has evolved. To do so, we need to compute the rate of change of the periods 1990-1995 and 1995-2000. Afterward, we compute the relative change between these two numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* First, the **rate of change**–also known as the slope of a linear function–is defined as the rate at which a variable changes in relation to another variable. It is computed as $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $m$ is the rate of change we want to compute, $y$ is the dependent variable, and $x$ the independent variable. In our case, $y$ is the number of estimated cases and $x$ the years where these cases were reported.\n",
    "* Second, the **relative change** is used to show the difference between two quantities. The computation of the relative change is as follows: $relative\\_change = \\frac{x - x_{ref}}{x_{ref}} \\times 100\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create the function `compute_relative_change()` that returns a dictionary whose keys are country names (string) and its values are float numbers representing the relative change between the rates of change from 1990-1995 and 1995-2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "* Use the `dataset` global variable.\n",
    "* Consider only the estimated number of cases for each relevant year to compute the rate of change.\n",
    "* Ignore countries where the number of estimated cases is unknown (i.e. `-1`) for at least one year.\n",
    "* Ignore countries where the number of estimated cases is equal to `0` for at least one year.\n",
    "* Include the `'Global'` case in the analysis.\n",
    "* Set the value of the relative change to `0` if the rate of change from 1990-1995 is equal to `0` (we cannot divide by zero!)."

    "\n",
    "In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly defined a list of 17 global goals designed as a blueprint to have a more sustainable and better future for everyone on Earth. These goals are known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and they are meant to be achieved by 2030. In particular, Member States promised to achieve the end of AIDS by 2030. This is done as part of the targets associated with ensuring healthy lives for all people. It is also related to other goals such as ending poverty (Goal 1) and hunger (Goal 2), ensuring quality education (Goal 4), achieving gender equality (Goal 5), promoting economic growth (Goal 8), reducing inequality (Goal 10), making cities safe and resilient (Goal 11), promoting peaceful and inclusive societies (Goal 16), and strengthening means of implementation (Goal 17). For more information on how these goals can improve the current situation of the HIV/AIDS epidemic go to [this website](https://www.unaids.org/en/AIDS_SDGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "> A core principle of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and of the AIDS response, is that no one should be left behind. The AIDS epidemic cannot be ended without the needs of people living with and affected by HIV, and the determinants of health and vulnerability, being addressed. People living with HIV often live in fragile communities and are frequently discriminated against, marginalized and affected by inequality and instability—their concerns therefore must be at the forefront of sustainable development efforts. - UNAIDS on \"AIDS and the sustainable development goals\"\n",

    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "> 'HIV/AIDS remains highly stigmatized because it is sexually transmitted. Every society attaches its own particular taboos or exerts a tremendous amount of judgment surrounding sexual practices. There’s a prevailing attitude that a person who acquires a disease through sex “deserves their fate” or “was asking for it.” Some people also think it’s OK to discriminate against people who use drugs, people who engage in sex work, and LGBT people. Of course, such thinking is the height of hypocrisy, not to mention inhumane, but it makes it very easy to write off entire populations as being unworthy of our help and concern. As a result, HIV/AIDS remains a disease of the marginalized, the poor, and the dispossessed.' - Elton John on World Day AIDS for MSNBC.
