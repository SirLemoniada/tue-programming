    "Persepolis or Parseh (\"تخت جمشید\" in Persian) is the name of a grand ceremonial complex (rather than a \"city\" in the normal sense) of ancient Iran. It is situated in the north of Marvdasht city and at a distance of 57 km from Shiraz in Fars province. This building is known as the ceremonial capital of the [Achaemenid Empire](https://www.worldhistory.org/Achaemenid_Empire/) (c. 550–330 BC), and it is a unique masterpiece that exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Until recent challenges, most archaeologists held that it was especially used for celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year, held at the spring equinox, and still an important annual festivity in modern Iran.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan of this complex was laid during the reign of Darius the Great - 515 BC - and its construction and completion were continued by Xerxes (son of Darius) and Ardashir I (his grandson). The palaces of Persepolis have been very diverse. Persepolis has about fifteen large palaces and halls with royal architecture, all of which were magnificent and had columned halls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persepolis was taken from Darius III by the army of [Alexander the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great) in 330 BC, and the wooden parts of the complex were completely destroyed by fire soon after.\n",

The mechanical advantage of the composite spool system (first mentioned in Greek works) depends on the number of spools. Thus, for example, the system consists of three spools provides a mechanical advantage of 3 to 1. This means that 3 kg can be moved with 1 kg of force.\n",

    "Other tools used for pulling with ropes were well wheels or winch. These tools were invented almost at the same time as composite spools. Winches are of two types: (1) with a horizontal axis like a normal well wheel (horizontal winch) and (2) with a vertical axis like an extraction wheel (vertical winch). The mechanical advantage of both of these devices is described based on the ratio of the length of the handles to the radius of the axis. Thus, the mechanical advantage of a horizontal winch, for example, with a handle length of 60 cm and a shaft radius of 15 cm is 4 to 1, and the mechanical advantage of a vertical winch with a handle length of 100 cm and a radius of 20 cm is 5 to 1.\n",
